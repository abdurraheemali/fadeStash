##__So..what is this? ðŸ¤”__  
I made an immersive Bluetooth-enabled Game Contoller that can play both MineSweeper and Space Invader using ESP32, accelerometer, and a bunch of other electronics.

##__Features   ðŸŒŸ__  
!!! info inline end

    This is just a very brief write-up of the project. __The full, detailed, documentation
    can be found [here](https://github.com/fadli0029/finalproject/tree/main/Project)__

- Uses __ESP32__ and __accelerometer__ to detect player's __movements and reactions__.
- An __immersive Bluetooth-enabled Game Controller__ that can play both MineSweeper   ðŸ’£ and Space Invader   ðŸ‘¾ .
- A __"Jumping Jacks Mode"__ for the MineSweeper game, where a player is required to perform a number of jumping jacks in order to choose a particular tile. Detection of this jumping jack is achieved via Digital Signal Processing on the Acceleromter Data.

- The brain of the car is the powerful [__Jetson NANO__](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit).
- It also features a [__PID Controller App__](https://guitar.ucsd.edu/maeece148/index.php/2021SpringTeam1#Phone_App), which allows user to __tune the PID of the car__, live while it's driving. This is achieved via [__MQTT protocol__](https://mqtt.org/) and a [__PID Controller class__](https://github.com/ArthurDassier/Mjolnir_kit/blob/master/scripts/class_PIDController.py).
- A __custom PCB board__ for __power distribution__ and an __LED board__ to add aesthetics to our car.

##__Official Documentation   ðŸ“‘__  
The official documentation is currently hosted [__here__](https://guitar.ucsd.edu/maeece148/index.php/2021SpringTeam1), though I am considering to document it on this project page too. So, stay tuned!
