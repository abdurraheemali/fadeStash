# So.. what is this  ðŸ˜¬ ?
These are my notes from self-studying a very useful course on Discrete Math & Probability Theory, CS70, at UC Berkeley.  

Most of these notes are my attempt to make sense of what the authors are trying to deliver in the notes. i.e: `the how's and the why's`  

Feel free to use them if they help!
