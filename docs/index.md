> # __What's up with this documentation-style personal website? 🔍__

A while ago, I made a website in pure `html`, `css`, and `javascript`. It's pretty good, as you can see in the `gif`:  

<img src="assets/images/oldwebsite.gif" width="400" height="400"/>  

But something is missing 🤔.  

I don't have a blog page, and I like to keep my notes online, or more accurately: I need something that is quick and easy to maintain, i.e: version control.  
And one more thing, no one can argue that "maitaining" a website in `markdown` is the most ideal thing to do for tech (developers) people. Increase 🚀 productivity, faster 💨, less headache 🚫 🤒.  

__The solution__: I resorted to [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org), a famous static website generator built in `Python`, usually meant for project documentation. The [Material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme add the 🍒 on top perfectly!  
That said, enjoy my new site 🕺!

* __`Blog`__ - Where I will post (well hopefully) tech-related stuffs like guides, academics, etc.
* __`Notes`__ - Hopefully no more writing on papers. You can use my notes freely, and I hope they're useful!
* __`Projects`__ - Seriously, take a look at them.
* Press ++slash++ key to search for anything and everything in the __entire__ website.
