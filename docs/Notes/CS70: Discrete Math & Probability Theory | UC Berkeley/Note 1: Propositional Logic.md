## Much Ado About Negation

Consider a universe $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and we let $P(x)$ be a __propositional formula__ "$x^2 > 10$".  

The note asserts the following:

1. $\exists xP(x)$ is `true`
2. $\forall xP(x)$ is `false`
3. $\neg (\forall xP(x))$ is `true`
4. $\exists x\neg P(x)$ is `true`
5. $\forall x\neg P(x)$ is `false`
6. $\neg(\exists xP(x))$ is `true`

Let's look at them one by one:
