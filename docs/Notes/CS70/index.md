# So.. what is this  ðŸ˜¬ ?

These are my notes from self-studying (trying) a very useful course on [Discrete Math & Probability Theory, CS70](http://www.fa19.eecs70.org/), at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).  

Most of these notes are my attempt to understand and make sense of what the authors are trying to deliver in the notes. i.e: `the how's and the why's`  

Feel free to use them if they help  ðŸ™‚!  

Oh one more thing,
