## Much Ado About Negation

Consider a universe $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and we let $P(x)$ be a __propositional formula__ "$x^2 > 10$".  

The note asserts the following:

1. $\exists xP(x)$ is `true`
2. $\forall xP(x)$ is `false`
3. $\neg (\forall xP(x))$ is `true`
4. $\exists x\neg P(x)$ is `true`
5. $\forall x\neg P(x)$ is `false`
6. $\neg(\exists xP(x))$ is `true`  

Let's take a look at them one by one:  

1.  $\exists xP(x)$  
    -  Informally, this statement is just saying "__Hey, if I take a number $x$ in the universe, there must be an $x$ in the universe such that $x^2$ is `greater than` $10$.__" And this is of course `true` because for __$x=4$__, $x^2=16$, and that is greater than $10$.

2.  $\forall xP(x)$  
    -  Informally, this statement is just saying "__Hey, for every number I take in the universe, each of that number is greater than $10$"__. Well this is certainly `false` since __$1, 2, 3$ will make the proposition $P(x)$ `false`__.

3.  $\neg (\forall xP(x))$
    -  We know from `2`. that the "statement" in bracket is `false`, and __negation, $\neg$,__ is `true` when the "statement" it's wrapping is `false`. So this is `true`.  

4.  $\exists x\neg P(x)$  
    -  $\neg$ of propositional statement $P(x)$ is saying the opposite of it, i.e it's saying "__Hey, if I take a number $x$ in the universe, there must be an $x$ in the universe such that $x^2$ is `less than` $10$__". And we know $1^2, 2^2, 3^2$ is less than $10$. So this is `true`.

5.  $\forall x\neg P(x)$  
    - This is like from number `4` except that instead of saying there has to be a number that is `less than` $10$, it's saying __all__ $x$ in the universe will be `less than` $10$. This is `false` because $16$ (when $x=4$) is `greater than` $10$.

6.  $\neg(\exists xP(x))$  
    -  We know from `1`. that the "statement" in bracket is `true`, and __negation, $\neg$,__ is `true` when the "statement" it's wrapping is `false`. So this is `false`.  

The following laws hold `true` for __any proposition $P$__ quantified over __any universe__ (including infinite ones):  

$$
\neg (\forall xP(x)) \equiv \exists x\neg P(x)  
$$

$$
\neg (\exists xP(x)) \equiv \forall x\neg P(x)
$$  

Now, let's look at some "hairy" ones from the notes:
