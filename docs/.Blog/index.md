## [Quick Bootstrap Ubuntu 20.04]

__This is the story of how we managed to completely rebuild client-side search,
delivering a significantly better user experience while making it faster and
smaller at the same time.__

The search of Material for MkDocs is by far one of its best and most-loved
assets: multilingual, offline-capable, and most importantly: _all client-side_.
It provides a solution to empower the users of your documentation to find what
they're searching for instantly without the headache of managing additional
servers. However, even though several iterations have been made, there's still
some room for improvement, which is why we rebuilt the search plugin and
integration from the ground up. This article shines some light on the internals
of the new search, why it's much more powerful than the previous version, and
what's about to come.
